# Questions 3:
# Write a program that takes cost price and selling price as input and displays whether the transaction is a
# Profit or a Loss or Neither.
# INPUT FORMAT
# The first line contains the cost price.
# The second line contains the selling price.
# OUTPUT FORMAT
# Print "Profit" if the transaction is a profit or "Loss" if it is a loss. If it is neither
# profit nor loss, print "Neither".(You must not have quotes in your output)

cost_price = int(input())
selling_price = int(input())

if (selling_price - cost_price) > 0:
    print("Profit")
elif (selling_price - cost_price) < 0:
    print("Loss")
else:
    print("Neither")
